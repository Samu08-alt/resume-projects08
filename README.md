This project predicts customer churn (whether a customer will leave a service or not) using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. 
It demonstrates the full ML pipeline — from data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to evaluation and deployment readiness.
Customer churn prediction is widely used in industries like telecom, banking, and subscription-based services to identify customers at risk of leaving, helping companies take proactive actions.
