# LIC AI Policy Recommender

This project is an **AI-powered insurance recommendation system** for LIC (Life Insurance Corporation) policies.  
It helps users find the most suitable policy based on their **age, goals, income, risk tolerance, and financial situation**.

## Features
- Personalized LIC policy recommendations
- Clear explanation of why a policy is suggested
- Logs each recommendation with timestamp for tracking
- Interactive UI using `ipywidgets` in Jupyter Notebook
- Scoring system considers age, risk, goal, income, and existing cover

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas & NumPy (data handling and analysis)  
- ipywidgets (interactive UI)  
- OpenAI API (optional, for polished recommendation text)

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook `LIC_policy_recommender.ipynb` in Jupyter.  
2. Run the cells sequentially to load libraries and functions.  
3. Use the interactive form to enter your details.  
4. Get top policy recommendation along with explanation.  
5. The recommendation is saved automatically in `recommendations_log.csv`.

## Optional
- Extend the notebook with **more LIC policies** in the catalog.  
- Convert it to a **Streamlit app** for a full web interface.

- Also we can give all LIC policies data to the project for better performance
